?: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-> Answer:
In Java, you can't have two constructors with the same signature, including the same parameter types.
With the same parameters lists & ambiguity with the same data type input, it will be to constructor overloading.
